## Overview of Project:
___________________________________________

We are working with a biological researcher in a microbiology laboratory. We are researching bacteria species that synthesize proteins that taste like beef. We are working with a food start up Improbable Beef to research bacteria species to find the perfect taste. Roza believes there is a microorganism that can provide the taste that Improbable Beef is looking for and it is found on the human body. To test Rozas beliefs she has tested candidates across United States to research her hypothesis. Our task is to make the test results accessible to research participants and colleagues on a website. Users will be able to select subject ids and view the results to see which bacteria live in the participants navels. Access [Belly Button Data](http://127.0.0.1:5500/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/index.html) here.
